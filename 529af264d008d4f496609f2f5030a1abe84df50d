      "message": "Thank you for your feedback regarding the commit. I understand that such changes might seem minor, but I’d like to provide some context.\n\nThis effort is part of an ongoing initiative to improve the overall readability and reliability of the codebase. While it might not have immediate functional impact, correcting spelling mistakes helps establish a polished and professional codebase. Moreover, we’ve noticed that the OpenBMC project, as a whole, contains numerous such errors, which can detract from its credibility and perceived quality.\n\nBy addressing these issues incrementally, we aim to create a cleaner and more maintainable codebase that reflects the high standards we strive for.\n\nI hope this clarifies the intent behind the change. These commits are generated by a tool and from an automation that i have wrote locally. I’m happy to discuss further if there are concerns about the approach.",
